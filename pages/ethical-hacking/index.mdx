# Ethical Hacking: Your Gateway to Cybersecurity

### What Is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical Hacking is the practice of probing systems, networks, and applications to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do. It’s about thinking like a hacker, but with the goal of safeguarding rather than exploiting. By learning ethical hacking, you’re not just learning how to break things—you’re learning how to build stronger, more secure systems.
Why Learn Ethical Hacking?

In today’s interconnected world, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. Companies, governments, and individuals rely on digital systems to manage everything from personal data to financial transactions. This dependency makes security breaches potentially devastating.
